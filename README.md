Node.js applications are overwhelmingly being deployed to clouds, with [79%](https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report/#Where-Deploy-Code) of Node.js developers reporting using cloud providers for their production applications.

Whilst [almost half](https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report/#Tools-Technologies-Used) are using Docker, only [12%](https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report/#Tools-Technologies-Used) are using container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes, and [12%](https://evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease.php?reportID=27) of developers are building “Cloud Native” applications, and

CloudNativeJS is an open source community project that aims to provide best-practices, assets and tools to make it easier to get started building enterprise-grade, Cloud Native Node.js applications. These are not just cloud-hosted, but integrate with the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](http://cncf.io/) open source technologies and exploit the full potential that cloud platforms provide.

## CloudNativeJS Assets

The CloudNativeJS project currently provides the following assets. This set is expected to extend over time to include not just a wider set of CNCF technologies, but to also include DevOps best practices.

* [Node.js Module Insights](http://modules.cloudnativejs.io/)
* [Node.js Module LTS Policy](http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/ModuleLTS)
* [Template Dockerfiles](http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/docker)
* [Template Helm Charts](http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/helm)
* [Health Check Support](http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/cloud-health-connect)
* [Prometheus Monitoring](http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/appmetrics-prometheus)
* [OpenTracing Request Tracking](http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/appmetrics-zipkin)
